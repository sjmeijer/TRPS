This program demonstrates simple phonon propagation in a Germanium crystal.
It is based upon code provided by Daniel Brandt at SLAC.

The code has been modified to introduce a cubic Ge crystal 2 cm on axis with 
Aluminum TES's covering each face.

Each event begins with the generation of a single phonon at the center of the crystal. Propogation incorporates phonon scattering and down conversion processes. 

In the future a custom physics process that generates phonons from charged particle propagation will be added.
